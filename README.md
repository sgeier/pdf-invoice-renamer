## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Convert**: Transforms PDF first pages into JPEG images
2. **Analyze**: Sends images to OpenAI Vision API to extract invoice dates AND total amounts
3. **Rename**: Automatically renames PDFs with extracted date and price information

The tool intelligently identifies:
- **Invoice dates**: Billing/invoice dates (not due dates or other irrelevant dates)
- **Total amounts**: Final amounts to be paid including all taxes and fees (not subtotals or line items)

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- OpenAI API key ([Get one here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sgeier/pdf-invoice-renamer.git
   cd pdf-invoice-renamer
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up your OpenAI API key**
   
   **Copy the environment template:**
   ```bash
   # Copy the example file
   cp env.example .env
   
   # Windows
   copy env.example .env
   ```
   
   **Edit the .env file:**
   Open `.env` and replace `your-openai-api-key-here` with your actual OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
   ```
   
   **Get your API key**: Visit [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) to create one.
   
   **Alternative - Use the setup script (Windows):**
   ```bash
   setup-env.bat
   ```
   This will guide you through creating the .env file interactively.

## üéØ Usage

### Single Directory Processing
```bash
node convert-pdfs.js "path/to/invoice/folder"
```

### Multiple Files in One Directory
The script processes all PDF files in the specified directory:
```bash
node convert-pdfs.js "path/to/invoice/folder"
```

### Mode Options
```bash
# Full automatic processing (default) - extracts dates AND prices
node convert-pdfs.js "folder" auto

# Convert to images only
node convert-pdfs.js "folder" convert

# Rename with provided data (legacy mode)
node convert-pdfs.js "folder" rename '{"file1.pdf":{"date":"2024-03-15","total":"29.99"}}'
```

## üìä Example Results

| Original Filename | Extracted Date | Extracted Price | New Filename |
|-------------------|----------------|------------------|--------------|
| `694c1fcd-70cb-4346-a23d-1ab6bdcdd0fd.pdf` | July 2, 2023 | ‚Ç¨29.99 | `2023-07-Jul_‚Ç¨29.99_694c1fcd-70cb-4346-a23d-1ab6bdcdd0fd.pdf` |
| `invoice-04029-30703330.pdf` | March 15, 2024 | ‚Ç¨156.80 | `2024-03-Mar_‚Ç¨156.80_invoice-04029-30703330.pdf` |
| `Made_With_AI_164359013.pdf` | January 8, 2023 | ‚Ç¨11.99 | `2023-01-Jan_‚Ç¨11.99_Made_With_AI_164359013.pdf` |

### Real-World Example from Google Invoices:
```
Before: "1079562573546578-33.pdf"
After:  "2022-07-Jul_‚Ç¨11.99_1079562573546578-33.pdf"

Before: "619935639187-228.pdf" 
After:  "2022-03-Mar_‚Ç¨36.99_619935639187-228.pdf"
```

## üîç Search Benefits

With the new naming format, you can easily:
- **Find expensive invoices**: Search for "‚Ç¨1" to find invoices over ‚Ç¨ 100
- **Find by price range**: Search "‚Ç¨2.99" to find cheap subscriptions
- **Sort by amount**: Files naturally sort by date, but you can also filter by price
- **Track spending**: Quickly see how much you spent in any given month

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

```
pdf-invoice-renamer/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ convert-pdfs.js          # Main script with date & price extraction
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ setup-env.bat           # API key setup helper (Windows)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ env.example             # Environment template
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env                    # Your API key (create from env.example)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json            # Dependencies
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md               # This file
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The script automatically creates an `images/` folder in each processed directory containing the converted JPEG files for reference.

### Supported Data Extraction
**Dates**: The AI automatically identifies invoice/billing dates in various formats and languages
**Prices**: The AI finds the final total amount including taxes and fees, ignoring subtotals

### File Naming Convention
`YYYY-MM-Month_‚Ç¨XX.XX_originalfilename.pdf`
- `YYYY`: 4-digit year
- `MM`: 2-digit month (01-12) 
- `Month`: 3-letter month abbreviation (Jan, Feb, Mar, etc.)
- `‚Ç¨XX.XX`: Total amount with 2 decimal places
- If only date is found: `YYYY-MM-Month_originalfilename.pdf`
- If only price is found: `‚Ç¨XX.XX_originalfilename.pdf`

## üí° Use Cases

- **Personal Finance**: Organize personal invoices with amounts for budget tracking
- **Small Business**: Manage vendor invoices with totals for expense reports
- **Accounting**: Prepare invoice files with amounts for bookkeeping software
- **Tax Preparation**: Chronologically organize tax-relevant documents with amounts
- **Digital Archiving**: Convert legacy invoice systems to organized format with pricing data
- **Expense Tracking**: Quickly identify high-value transactions or recurring costs

## üîí Privacy & Security

- **Local Processing**: PDF conversion happens locally on your machine
- **Secure API**: Only image data is sent to OpenAI for date and price extraction
- **No Data Storage**: OpenAI doesn't store the processed images
- **API Key Security**: Your API key is stored in `.env` file (automatically ignored by git)
- **Never commit your .env file**: The `.env` file is gitignored to prevent accidental API key exposure

## üí∞ Cost Estimation

Using GPT-4o-mini Vision API:
- **~$0.00015 per image** (very affordable)
- **100 invoices ‚âà $0.015** (less than 2 cents)
- **1000 invoices ‚âà $0.15** (15 cents)

*Even with the enhanced price extraction, costs remain the same as we use a single API call per invoice.*
